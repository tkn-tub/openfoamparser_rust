# OpenFOAM Parsing in Rust

openfoamparser lets you parse OpenFOAM simulation results just
like the Python library [openfoamparser](https://github.com/ApolloLV/openfoamparser.git).

Known limitations:
- Parsing binary files is not supported yet.

- [Crate on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/openfoamparser)
- [Documentation](https://docs.rs/openfoamparser)
